## Ludicrum Webshop WordPress Theme

The WordPress and WooCommerce theme for the Ludicrum - Making T-shirts because it's fun webshop. Based on Bootstrap with sass, using npm with nodemon, node-sass and clean-css for easy builds.

## Motivation

Freedom! Running your own webshop and digital marketing campaigns require total control of the framework and ecommerce system. Making our own theme gives us just that!

## Installation

Install using `npm install`. Build CSS after updates with `npm run build`, or simply run the command `npm run watch` to build and minify the style.css file on every save.
